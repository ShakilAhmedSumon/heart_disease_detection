# heart_disease_detection

This project had been developed as part of my machine learning course.

Here I tried to predict heart disease using a small dataset from the UCI repositary.

I used SVM, MLP, KNN and Decision Tree classifier for that purpose. I implemented these algorithms using scikit-learn library.
